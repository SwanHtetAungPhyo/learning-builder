## ðŸ“š Go Learning Repository

This repository is a collection of practical projects, mini-tools, and concepts I've explored while learning the Go programming language. It covers everything from the basics to more advanced topics, with real-world use cases and concurrency-driven designs.

### âœ¨ Topics Covered

- **Go Basics**: Variables, types, structs, slices, maps, interfaces, methods
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines, channels, `sync.WaitGroup`, `sync.Mutex`, `sync.Map`, worker pools
- **Web Development**: Building RESTful APIs with [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/)
- **Database Integration**: Using GORM with MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT, user registration, and login systems
- **File Handling**: Uploads, metadata storage, and hashed file management
- **Command-line Tools**: Mini utilities using Goâ€™s CLI capabilities
- **Testing**: Writing unit tests with Goâ€™s testing package
- **System Utilities**: Resource monitoring, custom logging, etc.
- **DSLs and Interpreters**: Experiments with lexers, parsers, and basic interpreters using ANTLR4

### ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This repository serves as both a **learning journal** and a **technical showcase** of my journey in mastering Go. Each project is self-contained and includes meaningful comments, clean architecture, and a focus on idiomatic Go practices.
